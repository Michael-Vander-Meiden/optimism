# Lib_Buffer



> Lib_Buffer



*This library implements a bytes32 storage array with some additional gas-optimized functionality. In particular, it encodes its length as a uint40, and tightly packs this with an overwritable &quot;extra data&quot; field so we can store more information with a single SSTORE.*
